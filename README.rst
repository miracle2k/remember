Remember
========

A simple webapp to collect notes that you want to review later, in order
to help you memorize them. If that's not clear, don't worry, you probably
won't find it useful. It's a thing I do.

But maybe someone is interested in the code, which is backbone.js_ based.
In fact, it's a modified version of the backbone.js `Todo example app`__.

Notable external libraries used:

   - backbone.js_  in a `modified <https://github.com/miracle2k/backbone>`_
     version, with changes as used by Flow_.
   - jquery-elastic_ in a **modified** version, as used by Flow_.
   - moment.js_ for dates.
   - showdown.js_ for Markdown.
